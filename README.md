# cityfans-frontend
### Front-end code for the cityfans web project.

This is mostly vanilla. Using SCSS and Gulp to enhance output performance.

The `assets/css/app.scss` file is the raw one. Iâ€™m not familiar with Phoenix but it will probably output it into `phoenix.css`. 

`assets/img/ui` are there for UI-design purposes. The ones in `assets/img/content` are for mocking up only and can be replaced by the actual ones when integrated with real content.
